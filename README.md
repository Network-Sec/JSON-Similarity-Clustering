# JSON Similarity Clustering
Demo project and application of algorithm to find similar JSON objects. Those objects can be large and deep (4 levels was tested) and don't need to have the exact same structure. 

## Why?
`Fingerprinting` pretty much. Lots of applications, I made it for a `WiFi` project. The algorithm is fast and efficient, applicable for millions of objects. While a simple comparisson would need `O(n^2)` or more time, this is pretty fast. 

## About
Most of the `app` is actually code to create the searchable objects. I left it in there for better demonstration. The search functions are only a few lines and use `machine learning` principles.
